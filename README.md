 ## Python
 1. ### [Image Segmentation using Python’s scikit-image module.](https://towardsdatascience.com/image-segmentation-using-pythons-scikit-image-module-533a61ecc980)

We all are pretty aware of the endless possibilities offered by Photoshop or similar graphics editors that take a person from one image and place them into another. However, the first step of doing this is identifying where that person is in the source image and this is where Image Segmentation comes into play. There are many libraries written for Image Analysis purpose. In this article, we will be discussing in detail about scikit-image, a Python-based image processing library.


## OpenCV-Python
 1. ### [Face Detection with Python using OpenCV](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/face-detection-with-python-using-opencv-5c27e521c19a)
 
This tutorial will introduce you to the concept of object detection in Python using the OpenCV library and how you can utilize it to perform tasks like Facial detection.

Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualize human faces in digital images. This technique is a specific use case of object detection technology that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings or cars) in digital images and videos. With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a lot of importance especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing.
